    <span style="font-size: x-small; " class="style13">
    <span class="style15">The origin of Banasthali is unique in more ways 
    than one. Banasthali Vidyapith owes its existence neither to the zeal of an 
    educationist, nor to that of a social reformer. It is also not the creation of a 
    philanthropist&#39;s purse. It has arisen like the fabled phoenix from the ashes of 
    a blossoming flower Shanta Bai that had withered before its bloom. It is a 
    spontaneous filling up of the vacuum caused by Shantabai&#39;s death. Here, love, 
    eternal love has been the fountain head of all the thinking and action and this 
    spirit has been the motivating force.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span 
        class="style13"><br class="style15" />
    </span>
    <br class="style14" />
    <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was on October 6, 1935, Smt. Ratan Shastri and Pandit Hiralal Shastri (former 
    secretary in the home and foreign department) found Banasthali to fill up the 
    vacuum caused by the sudden death of their highly talented and promising 
    daughter Shantabai. They had high expectations that she would work for women&#39;s 
    cause when on&nbsp; growing up.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
    </span>
    <br class="style14" />
    <span class="style14" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 
    its establishment in 1935, Banasthali has aimed at providing the girls with an 
    education, which would enable them to secure a place of honour and equality in 
    the society.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
    <br />
    The 
    vision and mission of Banasthali is to provide the girls not simply with general 
    education but to enable them to compete on equal terms in a society.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br

    <span class="style14">
    Banasthali&#39;s work in the field of women&#39;s education has been of a special type. 
    It can neither be classified as routine type of work nor a social type of work 
    but a unique blending of the two.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br

    <span class="style14">
    Banasthali is deeply conscious of the crisis of values that marks the modern 
    society. In its view, education is one of the potent instrument for trying to 
    meet this crisis. Hence Banasthali&#39;s entire educational effort and program is 
    focused on the need of creating a proper sense of values among the students. In 
    this context it emphasizes a harmonious balance of the spiritual and scientific 
    values of the East and the West. Simple and natural living and an attempt to 
    strike a balance between individual freedom and social responsibility designed 
    to achieve the above objectives.</span><span
